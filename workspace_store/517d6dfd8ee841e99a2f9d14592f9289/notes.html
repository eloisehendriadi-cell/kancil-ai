<p><mark class="hi-imp">Key Concepts:</mark></p>
<ul>
<li><mark class="hi-imp">Cell:</mark> The smallest unit of life that can perform all the functions necessary for an organism.</li>
<li><mark class="hi-imp">Tissue:</mark> A group of cells with similar structures and functions that work together to perform a specific function.</li>
<li><mark class="hi-imp">Organ:</mark> An organ consists of more than one kind of tissue, working together to perform a specific function.</li>
<li><mark class="hi-imp">Organ System:</mark> An organ system is made up of several organs working together for a common purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p><mark class="hi-imp">Processes/Mechanisms:</mark></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cell division:</strong> The process by which new cells are produced from existing cells.</li>
<li><strong>Differentiation:</strong> The process by which a cell becomes specialised for a specific function.</li>

<td>Cell membrane</td>
<td>Controls what enters and leaves the cell</td>
<td>It is partially permeable, allowing some substances to pass through while blocking others.</td>

<tr>
<td>Mitochondria</td>
<td>Site of aerobic respiration</td>
<td>Where oxygen is used to break down food substances to release energy for cell activities.</td>

<td>Vacuoles</td>
<td>Stores substances within the cell</td>

<p><strong>Applications &amp; Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cell structure:</strong> The cell membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm are the three main parts of a cell.</li>
<li><strong>Tissue structure:</strong> Muscle tissue is made up of muscle cells, while plant tissue is made up of plant cells.</li>
<li><strong>Organ structure:</strong> An organ consists of several organs working together to perform a specific function. For example, the stomach contains gland tissue, muscle tissue and nerve tissue.</li>

What are the structures in the cytoplasm?•Ribosomesare attached to the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum or lie freely in the cytoplasm.•They are needed to make proteins in the cell.
•Aerobic respiration occurs in the mitochondria. •During respiration, oxygen is used to break down food substances to release energy for cell activities.siteofproteinsynthesis

What are the structures in the cytoplasm?•Vacuolesare fluid-filled spaces that store substances within the cell.•Plant cells have a large central vacuole that contains liquid called cell sap.•Animal cells have small vacuoles, called vesicles that contain water and food substances.
•Chloroplastsare absent in animal cells.•They contain chlorophyll that is essential for photosynthesis in plants.

How are cells organisedto form an organism?Organ•An organconsists of more than one kind of tissue, working together to perform a specific function.•For example:ØThe stomach contains gland tissue, muscle tissue and nerve tissue. These work together for the digestion of food.ØThe leaf contains mesophyll tissue, xylem tissue and phloem tissue. These work together for plant nutrition and transport.

How do we convert between micrometres and millimetres?
•There are 1000 μm in 1 mm. •To convert from millimetresto micrometres, we multiply the value by 1000: 1 mm = 1 ×1000 μm •To convert from micrometresto millimetres, we divide the value by 1000:1 μm = 11000mm
